The GPG function is auctally a caller for other functions.  To use it you just put 'GPG' in the subject line.  And then you construct the email as followed.

email:(the email address you sent the this email from.)
command:(The special GPG command you want to exicute.)
user:(The username you registred with(Some commands will accept random strings for this))
password:(The password you registed with(as with the user line some commands will accecpt random strings))
[start]
(Put stuff in here.  Anything in here is dependiant on what command you are running)
[end]

You then would encrypt this with my public key(you can obtain my public key by emailing me with 'public_key' in the subject line.
Here is a mini howto on gpg http://dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto.html .  Most linux systems will have this installed allready.  If you are on windows you will have to research it more your self.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a list of the commands that GPG currently has.
'sendback' - This is a simple test command that sends you back whatever was inbitween that [start] and [end] headers.  Send an email back with 'help sendback' for more infomation.
'check' - This is another test command.  This one sends you back infomation regarding infomation about your user account.  Send an email back with 'help check' for more infomation.

Eventually there will be a register command here.  But sadly thats still in the works.  So if you want to setup an account just email the details to jony123@jonys.info and ill fix you up.
